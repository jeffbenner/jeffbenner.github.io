<blockquote>
  <p>A new study from the New York Department of Transportation shows that streets that safely accommodate bicycle and pedestrian travel are especially good at boosting small businesses, even in a recession.</p>
  
  <p>NYC DOT found that protected bikeways had a significant positive impact on local business strength. After the construction of a protected bicycle lane on 9th Avenue, local businesses saw a 49% increase in retail sales. In comparison, local businesses throughout Manhattan only saw a 3% increase in retail sales.</p>

<p>I am sure those who claim there is a war on cars in Seattle will argue that Manhattan is some kind of exception, but I don&rsquo;t think we can afford to ignore the economic benefits of providing safe bike infrastructure. How many <a href="http://www.seattlebikeblog.com/2013/04/04/guerrilla-road-safety-group-politely-installs-illegal-bike-lane-protectors-on-cherry-street/" target="_blank">projects this cheap</a> could claim the same increase in local consumer spending, not to mention save lives?</p>
