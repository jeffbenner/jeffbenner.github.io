title: I can’t see how anybody who claims to love language can fail to marvel at the
  beautiful slipperiness of meaning that puns, like aquarium nets, momentarily catch
  and bring shimmering to the surface. Puns act to shatter or at least compromise
  meaning; a pun condenses unrelated, even opposing meanings, like a collapsing dwarf
  star, into a singularity. Maybe it’s this antisemantic vandalism that leads so many
  people to shun and revile them.
