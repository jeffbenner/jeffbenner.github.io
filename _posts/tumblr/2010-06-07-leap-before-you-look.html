<blockquote><p>W. H. Auden, December 1940:</p>
<blockquote>The sense of danger must not disappear:<br/> The way is certainly both short and steep,<br/> However gradual it looks from here;<br/> Look if you like, but you will have to leap.<br/><br/> Tough-minded men get mushy in their sleep<br/> And break the by-laws any fool can keep;<br/> It is not the convention but the fear<br/> That has a tendency to disappear.<br/><br/> The worried efforts of the busy heap,<br/> The dirt, the imprecision, and the beer<br/> Produce a few smart wisecracks every year;<br/> Laugh if you can, but you will have to leap.<br/><br/> The clothes that are considered right to wear<br/> Will not be either sensible or cheap,<br/> So long as we consent to live like sheep<br/> And never mention those who disappear.<br/><br/> Much can be said for social savior-faire,<br/> But to rejoice when no one else is there<br/> Is even harder than it is to weep;<br/> No one is watching, but you have to leap.<br/><br/> A solitude ten thousand fathoms deep<br/> Sustains the bed on which we lie, my dear:<br/> Although I love you, you will have to leap;<br/> Our dream of safety has to disappear.</blockquote></blockquote>
