  <p>More outrageously, AdSense has been known to ban political activists in the midst of their most pitched battles against state repression. In January 2012 a number of graphic photographs got Sahara Reporters, a Nigerian government watchdog site, banned. One set shows Nigerian police officers manhandling a protestor, Ademola Aderinde. Another shows Aderinde’s pants pulled down from his desecrated corpse. Google dropped Sahara Reporters for violation of the ban on “violent content.” Just as the ban on “adult” material makes no room for literary-comedic exceptions, the prohibition of violent content allows no exception for context.</p>
  
  <p>The gospel of the Internet and social media as enablers of the public good is seriously challenged by the case of Google and Sahara Reporters.
  This came at the height of the worldwide Occupy movements. AdSense had been working well, nearly doubling the site’s revenue, until Google cut it off. “Immediately I had the feeling that perhaps Google was working with the Nigerian authorities,” Omoyele Sowore, the founder of the site, wrote me in an email, “because YouTube had done similar things to us.” YouTube was purchased by Google in 2006. Sahara Reporters had much to fear from the government. It was, according to Sowore, “deeply involved in processing tonnes of photos and texts from citizen reporters across Nigeria, as there was ongoing police crackdown on peaceful protesters,” Sowore told me. His site was “at the forefront of exposing this [when] I get an alert from Google AdSense that we had violated the rules and would be taken off AdSense.” The photo on the page Google cited was of Aderinde.</p>
