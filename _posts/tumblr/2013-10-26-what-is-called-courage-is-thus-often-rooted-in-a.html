title: 'What is called ‘courage’ is thus often rooted in a kind of cowardice: one
  has only to think of all the situations in which, to make men kill, torture or rape,
  the will to dominate, exploit or oppress has relied on the ‘manly’ fear of being
  excluded from the world of ‘men’ without weakness, those who are sometimes called
  ‘tough’ because they are tough on their own suffering and more especially on that
  of others - the assassins, torturers and ‘hit men’ of all dictatorships and all
  ‘total institutions’, even the most ordinary ones, such as prisons, barracks or
  boarding schools - but also the new ‘hatchet men’ of modern management, glorified
  by neoliberal hagiography, who, themselves often subject to ordeals of physical
  courage, manifest their virility by sacking their superfluous employees. Manliness,
  it can be seen, is an eminently relational notion, constructed in front of and for
  other men and against femininity, in a kind of fear of the female, firstly in oneself.'
