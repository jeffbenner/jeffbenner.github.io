<blockquote><p>Is the grid plan that great? Sure, the maps of Paris up top look insane. How does anyone get anywhere, find anything or not die on those streets? </p>

<p>The maps of Seattle and Tacoma (bottom) resemble just about any city in the US. Look at how efficient, safe and logical they must be.</p>

<p>Look at the French maps again. See where all those jagged roads cross? At almost every one of those hubs is a square of sorts. All of them are ringed by cafés, shops and restaurants. Each evening they’re filled with patrons, all on the sidewalk facing the street watching each other. Jazz bands, accordion players, crooners and unfortunately clowns, perform at the smaller intersections. The larger hubs host monuments, parks or simply cool-ass shit.</p>

<p>It’s ironic that the square isn’t really possible with a grid (and zoning, and fast food, and city planners, and TV, and…)</p></blockquote>
