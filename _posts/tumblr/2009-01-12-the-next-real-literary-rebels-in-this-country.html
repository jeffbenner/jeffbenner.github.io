title: 'The next real literary “rebels” in this country might well emerge as some
  weird bunch of anti-rebels, born oglers who dare somehow to back away from ironic
  watching, who have the childish gall actually to endorse and instantiate single-entendre
  principles.  Who treat of plain old untrendy human troubles and emotions in U.S.
  life with reverence and conviction. Who eschew self-consciousness and hip fatigue.  These
  anti-rebels would be outdated, of course, before they even started.  Dead on the
  page.  Too sincere.  Clearly repressed.  Backward, quaint, naïve, anachronistic.  Maybe
  that’ll be the point.  Maybe that’s why they’ll be the next real rebels.  Real rebels,
  as far as I can see, risk disapproval.  The old postmodern insurgents risked the
  gasp and squeal: shock, disgust, outrage, censorship, accusations of socialism,
  anarchism, nihilism.  Today’s risks are different.  The New Rebels might be artists
  willing to risk the yawn, the rolled eyes, the cool smile, the nudged ribs, the
  parody of the gifted ironists, the “Oh how banal.” To risk accusations of sentimentality,
  melodrama.  Of overcredulity.  Of softness.  Of willingness to be suckered by a
  world of lurkers and starers who fear gaze and ridicule above imprisonment without
  law.'
