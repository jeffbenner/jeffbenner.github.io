In August, the <a href="http://www.bfi.org" target="_blank">Buckminster Fuller Institute</a> announced the winner of a <a href="http://www.bfi.org/mapcontest" target="_blank">contest</a> to recontextualize the Dymaxion map. The winning map (pictured above) was created by Nicole Santucci and her team at Woodcut Maps in San Francisco.</p>

<p>From the <a href="http://www.bfi.org/mapcontest" target="_blank">contest website</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Nicole Santucci and team created a wonderful display of global forest densities, an ever-increasing important issue with the continued abuses of deforestation. What’s more an actual woodcut version of the map was made in the process, allowing the 2-D version to transform into an icosahedral globe. As BFI Store Coordinator Will Elkins put it “They went above and beyond our call by creating a powerful display of relevant information using the subject matter itself as a medium. The idea, craftsmanship and end result are stunning.”</p>
