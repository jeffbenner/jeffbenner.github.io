  <p>It&rsquo;s not widely known, but Philip Morris — which helped underwrite Gladwell&rsquo;s early career as a journalist — loved his work so much that it named him in a confidential document as one of its top media assets, right along with Grover Norquist and Milton Friedman. Philip Morris&rsquo; top brass loved Gladwell&rsquo;s first book, &ldquo;The Tipping Point,&rdquo; for its defense of the tobacco industry&rsquo;s strategy of using advertising to lure young smokers. &ldquo;I recommend you read (or have one of your minions submit a book report on) The Tipping Point, by Malcolm Gladwell &hellip; Beyond the piece on teen smoking, there is some interesting, possibly useful, information,&rdquo; wrote Philip Morris exec Michael Fitzgibbon in an email to the company&rsquo;s resident behavioral scientist.</p>
