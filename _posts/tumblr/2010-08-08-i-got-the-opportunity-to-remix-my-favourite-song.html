  <p>I got the opportunity to remix my favourite song from Au Revoir Simone&rsquo;s beautiful album Still Night, Still Light. While listening to the song I realised how nice it&rsquo;d be to transform their straight 4/4 time synthpop into a whirlwind waltz or maybe a barcarole if you will. It took a long time to chop up all the syllables and the tiny tiny samples, but I think the result got the song into a whole swirling new direction.</p>
  
  <p>While making the remix, my mind started working in &frac34; and 6/8 time. I started looking around for tracks in that time signature to make a mix, I wasn&rsquo;t intending to but I couldn&rsquo;t help it. It was all a big swirl. After a while I heard it everywhere. In soul ballads, in polyrhythmical african pop, in old movies. In the ocean waves tumbling in against the shore, in the beat of a lovers heart. One two three, one two three..</p>

<p>This mix deserves a sweltering night, but it looks like it will be a week before Seattle gives us anything resembling heat.  For tonight at least, the mix can serve a yearning for real summer weather.</p>

<p>Edit:  Jens also has a new single out entitled &ldquo;The End of the World is Bigger Than Love&rdquo; that you can <a href="http://www.jenslekman.com/records/eotw.htm" target="_blank">download</a> if you&rsquo;re willing to hand over your email address.</p>
