<blockquote>
  <p>Late in the evening on September 30, 2013, the House Rules Committee Republicans changed the Rules of the House so that the ONLY Member allowed to call up the Senate&rsquo;s clean CR for a vote was Majority Leader Eric Cantor or his designee &ndash; all but guaranteeing the government would shut down a few hours later and would stay shut down. Previously, any Member would have had the right to bring the CR up for a vote. Democracy has been suspended in the House of Representatives.</p>
