title: Too soon, too late, so many missed opportunities - you’ve got to recognize
  luck when you see it. He has a lot of friends who waste time waiting for a miracle
  that will redeem them, transform the life they perceive as a melancholy pencil sketch
  into a richly-hued oil painting, friends blind to moments of happiness while waiting
  for that miracle to arrive. What’s more, you’ve got to be able to stand being lucky.
  Many of his friends do everything they can to destroy it because they’re sure that
  fulfillment could be worse than failure. They’re driven by the conviction that nothing
  is more like hell than heaven, that heaven exists only until they get there, or
  comes into existence only once they’ve left. They’re not convinced that something
  was right until it’s over.
