title: "If you’re a boy writer, it’s a simple rule: you’ve gotta get used to the fact
  that you suck at writing women and that the worst women writer can write a better
  man than the best male writer can write a good woman. And it’s just the minimum.
  Because the thing about the sort of heteronormative masculine privilege, whether
  it’s in Santo Domingo, or the United States, is you grow up your entire life being
  told that women aren’t human beings, and that women have no independent subjectivity.
  And because you grow up with this, it’s this huge surprise when you go to college
  and realize that, “Oh, women aren’t people who does my shit and fucks me.”\n\nAnd
  I think that this a huge challenge for boys, because they want to pretend they can
  write girls. Every time I’m teaching boys to write, I read their women to them,
  and I’m like, “Yo, you think this is good writing?” These motherfuckers attack each
  other over cliche lines but they won’t attack each other over these toxic representations
  of women that they have inherited… their sexist shorthand, they think that is observation.
  They think that their sexist distortions are insight. And if you’re in a writing
  program and you say to a guy that their characters are sexist, this guy, it’s like
  you said they fucking love Hitler. They will fight tooth and nail because they want
  to preserve this really vicious sexism in the art because that is what they have
  been taught.\n\nAnd I think the first step is to admit that you, because of your
  privilege, have a very distorted sense of women’s subjectivity. And without an enormous
  amount of assistance, you’re not even going to get a D. I think with male writers
  the most that you can hope for is a D with an occasional C thrown in. Where the
  average women writer, when she writes men, she gets a B right off the bat, because
  they spent their whole life being taught that men have a subjectivity. In fact,
  part of the whole feminism revolution was saying, “Me too, motherfuckers.” So women
  come with it built in because of the society. \n\nIt’s the same way when people
  write about race. If you didn’t grow up being a subaltern person in the United States,
  you might need help writing about race. Motherfuckers are like ‘I got a black boy
  friend,’ and their shit sounds like Klan Fiction 101.\n\nThe most toxic formulas
  in our cultures are not pass down in political practice, they’re pass down in mundane
  narratives. It’s our fiction where the toxic virus of sexism, racism, homophobia,
  where it passes from one generation to the next, and the average artist will kill
  you before they remove those poisons. And if you want to be a good artist, it means
  writing, really, about the world. And when you write cliches, whether they are sexist,
  racist, homophobic, classist, that is a fucking cliche. And motherfuckers will kill
  you for their cliches about x, but they want their cliches about their race, class,
  queerness. They want it in there because they feel lost without it. So for me, this
  has always been the great challenge.\n\nAs a writer, if you’re really trying to
  write something new, you must figure out, with the help of a community, how can
  you shed these fucking received formulas. They are received. You didn’t come up
  with them. And why we need fellow artists is because they help us stay on track.
  They tell you, “You know what? You’re a bit of a fucking homophobe.” You can’t write
  about the world with these simplistic distortions. They are cliches. People know
  art, always, because they are uncomfortable. Art discomforts. The trangressiveness
  of art has to deal with confronting people with the real. And sexism is a way to
  avoid the real, avoiding the reality of women. Homophobia is to avoid the real,
  the reality of queerness. All these things are the way we hide from encountering
  the real. But art, art is just about that."
