<p>Via <a href="http://www.messynessychic.com/2013/04/08/anywhere-but-here-ponte-tower/" target="_blank">Messy Nessy</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the midst of the South African Apartheid, Ponte City was emblematic of the country’s dehumanising system of racial segregation. Here, only wealthy white families were allowed to live in the outward-facing apartments, while the tube’s inner apartments  were reserved for their black servants, who lived in permanent gloom.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The 54-story tube has maintained a dark and fascinating post-apartheid history, gaining a reputation for drugs, violence, and suicide before being abandoned in the 90s. In this short film, the current tenants, a white minority who occupy the top floor, and the black majority, talk about what it is like living in this building made an icon for both its decadence and destitution.</p>
