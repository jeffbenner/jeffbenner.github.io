The full documentary is <a href="http://vimeo.com/13175192" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>Here in Seattle, a city also well known for its pioneering liberalism, our own public radio station just concluded a series on <a href="http://kuow.org/topic/black-seattle" target="_blank">being black in Seattle</a>. The series hits on a lot of the same issues as <i>Take This Hammer</i>, detailing how black Seattleites face gentrification, police discrimination, and social discrimination, but also explores how difficult it is for some black Seattleites just to establish connections with other members of the small and shrinking black population.</p>
