title: 'I don’t like this expression “First World problems.” It is false and it is
  condescending. Yes, Nigerians struggle with floods or infant mortality. But these
  same Nigerians also deal with mundane and seemingly luxurious hassles. Connectivity
  issues on your BlackBerry, cost of car repair, how to sync your iPad, what brand
  of noodles to buy: Third World problems. All the silly stuff of life doesn’t disappear
  just because you’re black and live in a poorer country. People in the richer nations
  need a more robust sense of the lives being lived in the darker nations. Here’s
  a First World problem: the inability to see that others are as fully complex and
  as keen on technology and pleasure as you are.'
