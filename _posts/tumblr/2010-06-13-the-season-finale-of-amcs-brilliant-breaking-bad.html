<p>The season finale of AMC&rsquo;s brilliant <em>Breaking Bad</em> is tonight. <em>The New Yorker</em> recently had an article on <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/05/31/100531fa_fact_finnegan" target="_blank">La Familia Michoacana</a> (subscribers only), a violent drug cartel that has captured parts of the state and the private sector in Mexico.  The piece offers a fascinating look at the real world of drugs and violence that likely inspired the fictionalized turf across the border from Walter White&rsquo;s Albuquerque.  Much of the violence that once seemed sensational (such as what happens to Danny Trejo&rsquo;s character) now appears grounded in a disturbing reality. If you have a subscription, I definitely recommend you read the article, however, the next best thing is this <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/2010/05/31/100531on_audio_finnegan" target="_blank">16 minute interview</a> with William Finnegan, the journalist who reported the story.</p>
