title: I’m not trying to glorify black people, or denigrate white people, I’m trying
  to point out, that we are - whether we like it or not - connected, and that our
  connection should be our triumph and glory instead of our shame.

<blockquote>I&rsquo;m not trying to glorify black people, or denigrate white people, I&rsquo;m trying to point out, that we are - whether we like it or not - connected, and that our connection should be our triumph and glory instead of our shame.</blockquote>&#8212;<p>James Baldwin in his <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDNkT4xH3YE" target="_blank">National Press Club speech</a>.</p>

<p>I have been bingeing on James Baldwin videos this week thanks to <a href="http://jeffbenner.com/post/65304374814/kamau-bell-interviews-jay-smooth-on-totally" target="_blank">Jay Smooth&rsquo;s recommendation</a>. He was a profoundly thoughtful and compassionate speaker, and we need more like him. It is easy to see the influence he has had on Smooth.</p>
