<p><a href="http://www.kansas.com/2013/10/20/3068874_suicide-rate-climbs-by-30-percent.html" target="_blank">Suicide rate climbs by 30 percent in Kansas</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“There has been an uptick in suicides in middle-class, white professional men. … We do likely attribute that incidence as being related to the economy, for men particularly. So much of their identity is tied up in their job, and they lose their moorings.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The world is a cold and lonely place when your identity is narrowly defined by your ability to accumulate money, privilege, and power, and the only net that could have caught you has been slowly dismantled to alleviate its burden on business and the privileged class that you long to join.</p>

<p>It is tragic that the popular male political movements like the Tea Party (predominantly older, white, and male) and the Men’s Rights Movement aren’t moving to correct for these values that have damaged the male psyche and oppressed the under-privileged for centuries, but have instead doubled down.</p>

<p>People who subscribe to rugged individualism bear extraordinary opportunity costs. Those who lose, lose twice. They lose what they invested, and they lose what might have become of the investment in the basic human needs of their community, which include their own. Those who win still lose the opportunity to invest in the lot of their community, to risk creating prosperity beyond just the bottom line.</p>
