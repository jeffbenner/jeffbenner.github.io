title: 'But to demand that a work be “relatable” expresses a different expectation:
  that the work itself be somehow accommodating to, or reflective of, the experience
  of the reader or viewer. The reader or viewer remains passive in the face of the
  book or movie or play: she expects the work to be done for her. If the concept of
  identification suggested that an individual experiences a work as a mirror in which
  he might recognize himself, the notion of relatability implies that the work in
  question serves like a selfie: a flattering confirmation of an individual’s solipsism.'
