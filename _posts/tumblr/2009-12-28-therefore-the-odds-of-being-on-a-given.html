title: Therefore, the odds of being on [a] given departure which is the subject of
  a terrorist incident have been 1 in 10,408,947 over the past decade. By contrast,
  the odds of being struck by lightning in a given year are about 1 in 500,000. This
  means that you could board 20 flights per year and still be less likely to be the
  subject of an attempted terrorist attack than to be struck by lightning.

<p>Maybe if Obama wasn&rsquo;t so soft on lightning we could all sleep more soundly.</p>
