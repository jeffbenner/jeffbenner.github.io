title: Of course, one of the time-tested mechanisms of preventing wage discrimination,
  unionization, has been in steady decline for decades. Jake Rosenfeld, associate
  professor of sociology at the University of Washington, has studied unions and is
  now researching the relationship between pay secrecy and wage discrimination. He
  told me that although there is not enough data to draw a direct causal line between
  pay secrecy and unfair wages, we do know that in the public sector, where wage transparency
  is far more common, pay tends to be more equal and benefits are more evenly distributed.
