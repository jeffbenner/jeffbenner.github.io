  All the Valley’s talk about transhumanism, human potential, life extension, and generally “changing the world” is a bunch of hooey. It’s a myth — in the pejorative sense of that term. It’s a fluffy religion meant to snooker young professionals into giving their employers everything they have and working their brains down to the myelin until they become too old to be relevant anymore.

  No, it’s worse than that.

  They don’t get too old to be relevant. They get too old to be cheap.

<p>Also love the quote that starts this off, where Zuckerberg implies that young people not having families allows them to “focus on what’s important.”</p>
