title: In reducing rock-and-roll to its harshest essentials, the new wave took Lou
  Reed’s aesthete-punk conceit to a place he never intended. For the Velvets the aesthete-punk
  stance was a way of surviving in a world that was out to kill you; the point was
  not to glorify the punk, or even to say fuck you to the world, but to be honest
  about the strategies people adopt in a desperate situation. The Velvets were not
  nihilists but moralists. In their universe nihilism regularly appears as a vivid
  but unholy temptation, love and its attendant vulnerability as scary and poignant
  imperatives. Though Lou Reed rejected optimism, he was enough of his time to crave
  transcendence. And finally—as “Rock & Roll” makes explicit—the Velvets’ use of a
  mass art form was a metaphor for transcendence, for connection, for resistance to
  solipsism and despair.

The piece originally appeared in Greil Marcus’ ‘Stranded’ collection, but is reprinted in ‘Out of the Vinyl Deeps,’ the anthology of Willis’ music criticism edited by Nona Willis Aronowitz.
