<blockquote>
  <p>Think of the question “What Would Jesus Do?”  There are many cases where there is no textual evidence about what the historical Jesus would have done. Still, most people have no problem telling you what they think Jesus would do. For many Christians of a generous spirit, the conception of Jesus’ personality is a synthesis of all the best human traits: love, justice, mercy, wisdom, strength, compassion, commitment to truth, and so on. This is a Jesus I can worship even if it happens that it is a Jesus who never existed. If the Western Tradition has distilled a vision of an ideal human, I should sit up and take notice, even if that vision of an ideal human has been falsely attributed to a particular historical individual.</p>
  
  <p>This is an example of a larger point: so much of humanity’s best efforts have been expressed in religious terms, that to throw out religion lock, stock and barrel is to throw out the gold along with the dross.</p>
