title: I remember one time I played this Robyn Hitchcock song for the guys in the
  van, and then they literally started shouting, ‘Turn it off! It’s horrible. It’s
  awful! And I found that I was nowhere near being able to say, ‘Oh I guess we just
  really disagree about things—where are we going to stop for lunch?’ It was more
  like. ‘I can’t believe you are rejecting me. What you’re really saying is that you
  don’t like me, and you’re saying it intentionally to try and hurt me.’ And that’s
  almost psychotic, but what it is for sure is a form of neediness. The neediness
  for approval of something I DIDN’T DO. It’s sort of ridiculous to feel affronted
  by people not having the same experience as I do. And it happened enough times that
  I really had to examine where I was coming from. And more than once I got into arguments
  about that subject.
