title: I think that surprise…whether it occurs in love, war, business, or what have
  you, produces the greatest effect of any single element. It gives the added momentum
  to the sort of see-saw of emotion from one position to another, and you get this
  extra push of thrill and discovery.…People don’t like to be told anything—I mean
  I don’t think they even like to be told their pants are open.
